### Use cache - Some functions, like _apt and _dpkg, are very slow. You can use a cache in
## order to proxy the list of results (like the list of available debian packages)
zstyle ':completion:*' use-cache on
zstyle ':completion:*' cache-path ~/.zsh/cache

## Prevent CVS files/directories from being completed
zstyle ':completion:*:(all-|)files' ignored-patterns '(|*/)CVS'
zstyle ':completion:*:cd:*' ignored-patterns '(*/)#CVS'

## With commands like `rm' it's annoying if one gets offered the same filename
## again even if it is already on the command line. To avoid that:
zstyle ':completion:*:rm:*' ignore-line yes
