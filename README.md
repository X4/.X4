A very fast ZSH Prompt

Just clone this repo, then run ./install, no worries it asks before doing anything.
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/X4/.X4.git "${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}/"`

Note: To get familiar with aliases just type `aliases=<TAB>` and ZSH will list all available aliases for you.
All aliases are namespaced, that means for you that ie. `g.<TAB>` will complete all git aliases.
